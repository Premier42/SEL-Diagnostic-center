## üåê HOW TO ACCESS

### 1. Open Fresh Browser Window

   ```
   Username: admin
   Password: password
   ```

   - Should redirect to dashboard immediately
   - If you see "Invalid security token", refresh the page and try again

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Dashboard Shows "Broken":

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   ```
   Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Clear cached images and files
   Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete ‚Üí Cached Web Content
   ```

2. **Hard Refresh**
   ```
   Windows: Ctrl+F5
   Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
   ```

3. **Try Incognito Mode**
   ```
   Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+N
   Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P
   ```

4. **Check Server is Running**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep "php.*8000"
   ```
   
   If not running:
   ```bash
   cd /home/shinzuu/Documents/SEL-Diagnostic-center
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public &
   ```

### If Login Fails:

1. **Refresh the login page** before attempting login
2. Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser
3. Check that you're using correct credentials: `admin` / `password`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Browser Cache:** Old cached pages may cause issues. Always hard refresh or use incognito mode for testing.

2. **Session Cookies:** Make sure your browser accepts cookies from localhost.

3. **Server:** Keep the PHP development server running. Check with:
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/php_server.log
   ```

4. **No PC Crashes:** All crash-causing issues have been eliminated:
   - No more infinite page reloads
   - No more heavy animations
   - No more memory leaks

## üéâ SUCCESS

Your application is fully functional and stable. The "broken dashboard" is likely just cached old pages in your browser. Clear cache and try again!
